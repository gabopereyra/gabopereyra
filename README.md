### Hi!, this is GaboðŸ‘‹, I'm a Java + Angular developer

## About me
<p align="justify">For almost 10 years I worked in the shoe industry, where my last role was laboratory leader, so how did I end up programming? Well, I was looking for a change for various reasons, and along that path a <strong>Java</strong>a course taught by <a href="https://eggeducacion.com/es-AR/">Egg Education</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://www.gylgroup.com/">G&L Group</a> emerged.</p>
<p align="justify">This course had the objective of being able to make fully functional applications, in fact that was the final work: creation and presentation of one.</p>
<p align="justify">After that time the possibility of working as a <b>Java backend developer</b>, mainly using <b>Spring</b>, at G&L Group. In parallel to this first work experience, I was able to join to the program proposed by the people of <a href="https://www.alkemy.org/">Alkemy</a>, which consists of developing a project simulating a real work environment, not only programming, also applying methodologies used today, being in this case Scrum the methodology adopted.</p>
<p align="justify">A few months after this (giant for me) change, appears the opportunity to join the Unitech team, where I began to take my first steps with a tool that I love: <b>Angular</b>. Today I continue there, working together with an excellent team, in projects related to the judiciary of the city of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p align="justify">But that isn't all I want to tell you about myself, because I would like to share that these changes led me to study again, and I proudly say that I am a future systems analyst, and as it is known that technology is very dynamic, and also very exciting, I like to dedicate time to continue learning new tools and deepening those that are already known.</p>

<p align="justify">If you would like to contact me, below I shared my email and my Linkedin profile, it will be a pleasure to meet you ðŸ˜„</p>
