### Hi!, this is GaboðŸ‘‹, I'm a Java developer

## About me
<p align="justify">For almost 10 years I worked in the shoe industry, where my last role was laboratory leader, so how did I end up programming? Well, I was looking for a change for various reasons, and along that path a <strong>Java</strong>a course taught by <a href="https://eggeducacion.com/es-AR/">Egg Education</a> and sponsored by <a href="https://www.gylgroup.com/">G&L Group</a> emerged.</p>
<p align="justify">This course had the objective of being able to make fully functional applications, in fact that was the final work: creation and presentation of one.</p>
<p align="justify">After that time I had the possibility to work as a <b>Java backend developer</b>, mainly using <b>Spring</b>, at G&L Group. In parallel to this first work experience, I was able to join to the program proposed by the people of <a href="https://www.alkemy.org/">Alkemy</a>, which consists of developing a project simulating a real work environment, not only programming, also applying methodologies used today, being in this case Scrum the methodology adopted.</p>
<p align="justify">A few months after this (giant for me) change, the opportunity appeared to join the <a href="https://www.unitech-corp.com/">Unitech</a> team, where I began to take my first steps with two technologies that I love: Angular and Quarkus. I spent about a year there, working alongside an excellent team, on projects related to the judicial branch of the city of Buenos Aires.</p>
<p align="justify">Actually I am at <a href="https://www.adistec.com/">Adistec Corp</a>, a technology distributor, where we make applications used by the different business units of the company, they are carried out with the support of the Spring framework for the backend, and React + Next for the frontend.</p>

<p align="justify">But that's not all I want to tell you about myself, because I would like to share with you that these changes led me to study again, and I proudly say that I am a future systems analyst, and as is known, technology is very dynamic, as well as very exciting, so I like to spend time continuing to learn new tools and deepen the ones I already know.</p>

<p align="justify">If you would like to contact me, below I shared my email and my Linkedin profile, it will be a pleasure to meet you ðŸ˜„</p>
